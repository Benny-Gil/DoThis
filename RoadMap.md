# To-Do Java Project Roadmap

## Project Setup and Basic Structure

- [x] **Setup Development Environment:**
    - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine.
    - Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

- [x] **Create Project Structure:**
    - Create a new Java project.
    - Organize the project structure with appropriate packages.

- [x] **Version Control:**
    - Initialize a Git repository for version control.
    - Commit the initial project structure.

## Task Class and Basic Functionality

- [x] **Define Task Class:**
    - Create a `Task` class with fields like title, description, priority, due date, etc.
    - Implement constructors and accessor methods.

- [x] **Implement Task Management:**
    - Create a basic mechanism for adding tasks to a collection.
    - Implement a method to display all tasks.

## User Interface (Console)

- [x] **Console User Interface:**
    - Design a simple console-based user interface.
    - Implement user input handling for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

- [x] **Task CRUD Operations:**
    - Implement methods for editing and deleting tasks.
    - Ensure proper validation for user inputs.

## Task Prioritization and Due Dates

- [ ] **Task Prioritization:**
    - Extend the `Task` class to include a priority field.
    - Implement functionality for sorting tasks based on priority.

- [ ] **Due Dates:**
    - Add the option to set and display due dates for tasks.

## Task Categories and Data Persistence

- [ ] **Task Categories:**
    - Implement the concept of categories for tasks.
    - Allow users to assign tasks to different categories.

- [ ] **Data Persistence:**
    - Implement basic file I/O to save and load tasks from a text file.
    - Ensure that tasks persist between application sessions.

## Refactoring and Testing

- [ ] **Code Refactoring:**
    - Review your code and refactor as needed for better organization and readability.
    - Consider implementing any design patterns that make sense for your project.

- [ ] **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of critical components.
    - Test the application with various scenarios.

## Final Touches and Documentation

- [ ] **Finalize User Interface:**
    - Polish the user interface for a better user experience.
    - Handle edge cases and errors gracefully.

- [ ] **Documentation:**
    - Update the README.md file with comprehensive documentation.
    - Include information on how to use the application and any additional details.

## Additional Features and Enhancements

- [ ] **Optional Features:**
    - Consider adding features like task search, reminders, or user authentication.
    - Explore integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX.

- [ ] **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Collect user feedback and make iterative improvements to your project.
    - Explore advanced Java concepts and libraries to enhance your skills.
